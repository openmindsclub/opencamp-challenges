# The Scriptwriters

Participants must create the concept and script for a 3–5-minute short documentary that tackles a real challenge faced by Algerian students, whether academic, social, environmental, or technological, and proposes a practical solution or a message of hope.

Note: The script should be realistic enough to film inside the campus with the available resources.

You're free to submit your work as text, slides, or a storyboard, but it must include:

- Title and central idea (What the documentary explores or questions)
- Outline or sequence (Scenes, narration, or structure of the story)
- Roles and materials (Who does what, and what’s needed to film it)
- Estimated duration (Should not exceed 5 minutes of final video)

Time limit: 2 hours
