# Open documentary

Participants will be assigned a script, and they must bring it to life. Using only what’s available on campus, they have to film and edit a short version of the documentary 3-5min based on the script they received. They’re free to interpret it and change it creatively but must respect its main idea and tone.

Time limit: 3 hours
