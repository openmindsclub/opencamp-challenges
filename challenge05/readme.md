# Open Maps for Algeria

Participants must brainstorm a practical and useful project that leverages OpenStreetMap or another open data / open-source resource (open datasets, Open Data Commons, OpenWeather, OpenTraffic, etc.) to solve a real problem for Algerian communities or students.
No coding required, teams must deliver a clear concept, feasibility plan, a visual prototype (paper mockups, wireframes, flowcharts, or a clickable Figma demo, etc).

Time limit: 2 hours
