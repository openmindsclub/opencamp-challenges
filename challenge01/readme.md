# The Open Source Advocate

Participants must choose an open-source software or tool that solves a real need and craft a clear, engaging tutorial or article that could genuinely convince others to use it. The piece should highlight the tool’s value, explain how to get started, and communicate its advantages over mainstream alternatives in a way that’s accessible yet persuasive.
